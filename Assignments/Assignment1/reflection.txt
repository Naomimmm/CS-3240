This assignment was a great learning experience and a great review of object-oriented programing principles.
I was able to refresh my knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism by implementing the overrides of the equals and hashCode methods. Implementing the equals and hashCode methods itself was a big learning experience since I was not familiar with how to implement them. I was able to learn about the two methods in the official Object documentation.

Another learning experience from this assignment was learning to use the iterator class in java. Since we did not have public access to the strings set of a language instance, I had to use the iterator in the concatenate method to be able to extract all the strings in the parameter language and add it to the concatenated language.
