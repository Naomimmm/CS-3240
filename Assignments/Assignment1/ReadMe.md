Assignment JL - Java implementation of Language
Develop a Java implementation of the Language class that exactly matches [this posted API](http://jodypaul.com/cs/theory/LanguageJava/Language.html). Note that this class must reside in the unnamed package, thus you must not use a package statement.

Language is a data structure implementation, thus there are no end-user interfaces to this class. All access is via the specified public methods.  System.out, System.err, and System.in must not be directly accessed by your program. Also note that there is no method with signature public static void main.

As a convenience, I have provided Java source code with scaffolding for Language class and a test class (both using the JUnit 4 framework and using no test framework). You should feel free to use this sample implementation of [Language.java](http://www.jodypaul.com/cs/theory/LanguageJava/Language.java)  while developing your class.  (It also uses TODO placeholders and comments to identify places where you must make changes.)  The unit test classes, [LanguageTest.java](http://www.jodypaul.com/cs/theory/LanguageJava/LanguageTest.java) and [LanguageTests.java](http://www.jodypaul.com/cs/theory/LanguageJava/LanguageTests.java), are incomplete and simplistic, addressing some basic functionality only.

For this assignment, you must submit one file named exactly Language.java that contains the source code for your implementation of the Language class. Files with any other name will be ignored by the assignment processor.

Submitted code must compile without error and exactly match the specified public API.

Submitted code is expected to be well-documented using Javadoc comments and tags. The class-level documentation must include properly populated @author and @version tags. The method-level documentation must use properly populated @param and @return tags as appropriate.

Assessment will consider correctness and readability.

You must also submit, via "Online text", a brief (~150 word) reflection addressing learning insights associated with your experience working on this assignment.
